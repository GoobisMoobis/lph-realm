    <p>
      The <b>BNR</b> is the governing entity behind most of the projects in the
      second season of realm 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was operated and owned by
      <b style="color: var(--fender)">GoobisMoobis000 (Fender)</b>, the owner of
      both the realm and this website.
    </p>
    <p>The BNR was constructed in the side of a mountain near a village.</p>
    <p>
      Due to buisness at the BNR, all of the farms he had built, and everything
      else he had done, the BNR caused
      <span style="color: var(--fender)">Fender</span> to become the richest
      player in season 2, with a wealth of so many emerald blocks he could
      afford to give away stacks and stacks and easily recoup the losses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The BNR was built up of a main area, with a zombie named
      <b>Jeremy III Jr</b> as a receptionist. Behind Jeremy was a secret
      pressure plate leading to the back of the BNR.
    </p>
    <p>
      The back of the BNR had 2 things: a keycard reader, and special 3x3 piston
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 3x3 piston door was the entry point to the shared treasury, a giant
      chest area that anybody could donate to.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a buisness dealing required resources from the treasury, it was used
      for that too.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the correct keycard was put into the reader, a secret door would open
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      This door led down into the dungeon (potion farm of the BNR) and jail.
    </p>
    <p>
      right under the dungeon, you'd recieve mining fatigue, to prevent prisoner
      escapes.
    </p>
    <p>
      the jail no longer exists with new BNR buildings, but was used to punish
      people who commited crimes.
    </p>

    <h3>Roles</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>The BNR had many jobs to help with it's operations. This includes:</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th scope="col">Job</th>
          <th scope="col">Common Nicknames</th>
          <th scope="col">Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">Representative</th>
          <td>Rep, R</td>
          <td>
            Representatives are the first point of contact for operations at the
            BNR. They act as a filter/summerizer. Most things people had
            questions about, a representative could answer or do. If they
            couldn't, the representative could set up a meeting between a
            superior and the client to get their needs sorted out.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">Jail Guard</th>
          <td>JG</td>
          <td>
            Jail Guards were special employees who had access to the jail in the
            BNR's backroom basement. They made sure that even if a prisoner
            spent the grueling minutes it took to break a block with their fist
            + mining fatigue, that they'd still be captured in jail. Jail guards
            no longer exist.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">Tresury Guard</th>
          <td>TG, T</td>
          <td>
            Treasury Guards guarded the treasury from theives who sought to
            steal from the BNR. They also were a first-responder for escaped
            prisoners.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">Protector</th>
          <td>P</td>
          <td>
            Protectors were almost like a higher level of Treasury/Jail Guard.
            They fought ANY and ALL battles for the BNR. If the BNR were to get
            into a war, protectors were the people fighting the battles. As
            such, they were paid the most. They also helped with escaped
            prisoners or theives.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row">Resource Gatherer</th>
          <td>RG, R</td>
          <td>
            Resource Gatherers were anybody who mainly gathered things for the
            treasury and/or farms. Simple job with good pay.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
