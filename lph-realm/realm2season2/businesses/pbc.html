    <h1>Los Pollos Hermanos Realm Projects: THE PBC</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The <b>PBC</b> was a public bank built by <b>Sandkins12 (Phoenix)</b> in
      <b>Realm 2 Season 2</b> of the Los Pollos Hermanos realm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The PBC, built up of a simple square ground floor, had a not-so-secret
      underground area in which valuables were stored in vaults with different
      passwords.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is unclear, but speculated that the PBC was owned by the much more
      powerful <b>BNR</b> due to the BNR ALSO being ran partly by Phoenix.
    </p>
    <p>The PBC was built next to the BNR.</p>
    <br />
    <h3>VAULTS</h3>
    <hr />
    The vaults in the PBC's underground area were 3x3 piston doors. Each one had
    a different password.
    <br />
    <h3>HISTORY</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>The PBC was built about 1 week after the BNR started costruction.</p>
    <p>The PBC was damaged by part of an attack by <b>Nathan (runy8f)</b></p>
    <p>
      During the end of the season 2 realm, everyone was given creative for fun,
      and tnt rained from the sky. the PBC no longer existed by that point.
